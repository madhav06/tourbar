# tourbar
MERN app

## M - mongoDB (database solution)
## E - express (a nodejs framework)
## R - react (browser-side javascript library)
## N - nodejs (server-side javascript runtime)

### So, here in this project we will be building a fullstack MERN application where our frontend will be in react and backend will be in Node.

 :octocat: **What is React ?**

 > A client-side (browser) library which allows you to build highly reactive user interfaces.
 > Responsible for controlling what users see on screen and how the things change there.

### A brief note on Node now...

 :octocat: **What is Node ?**

 > It's a javascript runtime often used to create server-side applications.
 > Node JS is used to execute javascript code outside the browser.

### A brief note on Express...
 :octocat: **What is Express ?**

 > A Node framework which simplifies writing server-side code and logic.
 > Express is for Node what Laravel for PHP.

### A brief note on mongoDB...

 :octocat: **What is mongoDB ?**

 > A NoSQL Database which stores "Documents" in collections instead of "Records" in tables as in SQL.
 > mongoDB often gives amazing performance because it is way more flexible.
 > We can use other DBs also but then it would not be MERN application.
 > Considered as a powerful database which can be easily integrated into a Node/Express environment.
